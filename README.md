# OpenGL-Bedroom-Scene
The goal of the bedroom scene project is to acclimate students with drawing shapes based on developer defined vertex and normal data. The students need to define predetermined objects, like a bed, nightstand, and fan with rotating blades. The scene also needs to be lit using the fixed-function pipeline in OpenGL. 

This iteration of the project contains one file for rendering. The "source.cpp" file defines the process needed to draw each primitive shape vertex by vertex. These primitives include a cube, sphere, cylinder, and cone. The source file then uses these primitive drawing functions to draw the objects in the scene. The program then defines the needed parameters for OpenGL to render and makes calls to the object drawing functions and renders the scene.
